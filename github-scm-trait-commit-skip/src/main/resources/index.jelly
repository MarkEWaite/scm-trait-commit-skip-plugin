<div>
  Extends the filtering abilities of the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-source/">GitHub Branch Source Plugin</a>.
  Ignores events when the source branch last commit contains the tags [skip ci] or [ci skip].
  The filtering is only performed for change request events, so push events to non-pull requests will be always run.
